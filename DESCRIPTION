Description:
    Implements microbial differential abundance analysis based on the Songbird framework
    by Morton et al.(2019) in R. This includes reimplementation of multinomial regression for 
    differential ranking using TensorFlow via R, as well as extensions for zero handling and 
    log-ratio hypothesis testing. Addtional functionalities include rank plotting with select
    OTUs and semi-automatic reference frame selection.
