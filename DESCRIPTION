Description: 
    A reimplementation of the Songbird algorithm by Morton et al. (2019) for microbial differential abundance analysis using multinomial regression. 
    This package enables OTU-level coefficient estimation with regression modeling, reference-agnostic ranking, and log-ratio significance testing. 
    An additional BMDD (Bimodal Dirichlet Distribution) modeling layer is introduced to handle zero inflation and compute posterior proportions 
    used in log-ratio calculations. The workflow supports both phyloseq objects and raw OTU + metadata input, and outputs beta coefficients, 
    log-ratios, and statistical comparisons between groups.
